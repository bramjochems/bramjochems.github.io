Hi, I am Bram Jochems, welcome to my site.

I am a derivatives professional with experience across many asset classes. I currently manage a team hedge that is responsible for hedging the market risks of a large block of VA policies for [NN Re][NN Re], as well as managing it's proprietary investments. In the past I've worked as a sell side derivatives trader in NY an Amsterdam.

Together with my wife and our three children, I currently live in the Netherlands. In my free time I play squash and try to learn the piano.
